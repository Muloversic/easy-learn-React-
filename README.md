# Pet project.

-   Application was made with a purpose to improve React skills and better understand it,
    after I took a free course from freeCodeCamp.
-   This application provides to user an ability to create different sets with words that user wants.
-   If user visited site for the first time, application wants from him to go to settings page and
    "create" account.
-   All data is being stored at Firebase database and Firebase storage.
-   User can create accaount by typing his name at settings page. Changing name will create new user,
    it's possible to "relogin" by changing back old nickname. Also user can choose profile picture.
-   At profile page user can see his statistic.
-   User should type all words and translation manually, if user wants he can add an extra translation,
    e.g in different language.
-   Application provides two variants to learn saved words: all together mode or one by one mode.
